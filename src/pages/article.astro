    <p class="card-undertext" id="marginunder">A Design Playground on Shelves</p>
    <p class="card-text" id="margintext">In Copenhagen, Nørrebro has a reputation for being the city's creative heartbeat - full of color, contrasts, and cultural experiments. Right here, you'll find Bastard Café Nørrebro, a playful twist on the neighborhood café concept where good design, gaming culture, and community spirit meet.</p>
    <p class="card-text" id="margintext">Step inside, and you're greeted by walls filled with board games of every kind - from indie gems with bold graphic design to iconic classics with timeless illustrations. For anyone interested in design and visual culture, the café doubles as a living exhibition of how creativity, storytelling, and aesthetics come together in something as simple as a game box.</p>

    <p class="card-undertext" id="marginunder">Coffee, Beer & Nørrebro Vibes</p>
    <p class="card-text" id="margintext">This is not your standard café. Sure, you can grab an espresso or a craft beer from a local brewery, but the real draw is the atmosphere. Nørrebro is known for its mix of cultures and styles, and Bastard Café reflects that energy: students, locals, and travelers all end up side by side, laughing over a deck of cards or debating strategy over a pint.</p>
     <p class="card-undertext" id="marginunder">A Social Shortcut into Copenhagen</p>
      <p class="card-text" id="margintext">For first-time visitors to Copenhagen, Bastard Café Nørrebro offers a chance to experience the city from the inside. Instead of sitting quietly with your laptop, you're invited into a playful community. Don't know the rules? The staff - “Game Gurus” - will happily introduce you to something new. It's an instant way to connect, whether you're traveling solo or in a group.</p>

It's a space where design meets play, where strangers become teammates (or rivals), and where you'll walk out with a story to tell about Copenhagen that goes beyond the usual tourist checklist.
So if you're young, creative, and curious, make sure Bastard Café Nørrebro is on your list. It's not just about games - it's about experiencing Copenhagen culture in its most playful form.</p>
